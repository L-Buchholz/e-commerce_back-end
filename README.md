# E-commerce_back-end

## Bootcamp homework

A manager for an internet retail company requires an updated e-commerce website back end in order to compete effectively in the market. The following "Acceptance Criteria" for this feature were requested and have now been implemented:

- The Express.js, dotenv, MySQL, and Sequelize programs have been initialized
- The development database has been seeded with test data
- The server begins with a command and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- The formatted JSON data is displayed when GET routes are invoked for Categories, Products, and Tags
- POST routes create Categories, Products, and Tags
- PUT routes update Categories, Products, and Tags
- DELETE routes delete Categories, Products, and Tags

Additionally, a video walk-through highlighting the program's functionality has been created and linked (below), and the Javascript includes comments.

The following is a screenshot of the Insomnia interface, highlighting the back-end program's appearance and functionality:

## UPDATE -- Link to video walk-through:

As the e-commerce back-end application cannot be deployed at a live URL, videos highlighting a walk-through of using this application are included here:
